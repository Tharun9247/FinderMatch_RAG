--->How I would add login authentication:

Simple Username/Password:

Add a login form at the start of the app.

Store credentials securely (e.g., in environment variables or a database).

Allow access only if credentials match.

OAuth / Social Login:

Integrate providers like Google, GitHub, or Microsoft.

Redirect users to provider for authentication and get a secure token.

Use token to grant access to the app.

Session Management:

After successful login, store a session variable or token.

Every app page checks this session to ensure the user is authenticated.

The authentication logic would live in the main app file or a separate auth module that runs before loading the app content.






--> How would I secure API keys and sensitive data?

Environment variables: Store API tokens locally (.env) or on deployment platforms (like Streamlit Secrets).

Secrets management: Use Streamlit’s secrets.toml to safely store API keys.

Never hard-code API keys in the code or push them to GitHub.

Access control: Only allow authenticated users to trigger requests using these keys.

Server-side handling: Keep sensitive data and requests on the server side; don’t expose them in the frontend.
